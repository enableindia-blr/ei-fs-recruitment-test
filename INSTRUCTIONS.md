## Hey, Please Read This!

We know it’s a bit long, but every bit counts. This document has all the juicy details that’ll help you shine in our recruitment process!

## What We’re Building

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a small community marketplace for Persons with Disabilities. This isn’t just any marketplace—it’s a space built with heart. Assume we're focusing on individual memberships only, so skip the organizational accounts for now. Users include persons with transient or permanent disabilities, their caregivers, and even folks without disabilities. Since anyone can buy or sell, treat these roles as flexible options, not rigid categories.

Your app should feature:

- **User Love:** Smooth registration, login, and logout.
- **Listings with Purpose:** Allow members to list the products and services they’re excited to offer.
- **Search & Shop:** Make it easy for members to find listings and start a purchase (ending at “Add to Cart” is totally fine).
- **Cart Management:** Let members review and tweak their cart—even if the checkout button isn’t live yet.
- **Smart Suggestions (Optional for Level 1):** Add a recommendation feature that suggests products based on the buyer’s profile (age, location, type of disability, etc.).
- **Progressive Web App Vibes (Optional for Levels 1 and 2):** Ensure it’s a responsive web app that can double as a progressive web app.
- **Accessibility First:** Build in accessibility features because our users deserve nothing less.

## Tech Stack Options

Pick your favorite TypeScript-based stack:

- **Option 1:** NestJS (Backend) + ReactJS (Frontend) with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
- **Option 2:** NextJS (Backend + Frontend) with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.

Feel free to throw in any open-source libraries or frameworks you love for state management, UI, caching, session handling, accessibility, and more.

## Levels of Challenge

We’re all about growth, so whether you’re just starting out or you’re a seasoned pro, choose the level that fits you best. Each level adds more cool challenges:

### Level 1 (Junior Developer)

Show us you can:

- Build a responsive web app with a solid, no-frills UI. Doesn't need to be pretty, but functionality is no-compromise zone.
- Nail all the mandatory features.
- Write clean, unit-testable code with some reusable modules.
- Deliver an app free of bugs and performance hiccups.

### Level 2 (Mid-level Developer)

Take it up a notch by:

- Setting up some unit tests (even just 2 tests per service/controller is fine).
- Optimizing your DB queries (think transactions and handling those tricky queries).
- Using strongly typed components (a few **x: any** spots are okay).
- Implementing state management and caching (with validation and revalidation).
- Keeping your code DRY and modular.
- Including a basic recommendation engine, like tag-based suggestions tied to user profiles.

### Level 3 (Senior Developer/Team Lead)

If you’re a veteran, we want to see:

- A robust, modular, and efficient architecture that’s testable across the backend, frontend, and database.
- Secure, broad-scoped APIs that can evolve without constant tweaks.
- Great handling of edge cases, far beyond Levels 1 and 2.
- A user-focused design that feels fresh and intuitive. Here, we mean functional design. You just need to be a pro at writing code. We have amazing UI ninjas on board to help with look and feel.
- Dynamic state management on both the client and server sides.
- Accessibility built right into your design.
- An advanced recommendation engine that goes beyond simple tag matching (feel free to use AI models if you’d like).
- A dual-mode app that works seamlessly as both a responsive web app and a progressive web app.

## How to Submit Your Magic

- **Fork & Build:** Fork this repository and push your creation to your own repo.
- **No Clock Watching:** There’s no hard deadline, but we’re eager to start reviewing as soon as we see your submission.
- **Show Off Your Process:** Update the README.md with an 8–10 line (or longer) write-up detailing:
    - Your app’s features.
    - The level you tackled.
    - Your approach, including your chosen stack, architecture, libraries, and any innovative twists you added.
- **Let Us Know:** Send an email with a link to your public repo so our team can dive into your work.
- **Be Honest with Your Tools:** Feel free to use tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, or Claude. Just be ready to talk about your code and show us you truly understand it.
